          <p class = 'hiddenFadeLeft'>Self-driving cars have neural networks and specific algorithms. These are artificial intelligence (AI) and
            machine language (ML) based object detection algorithms. These are used to collect data on the road, analyze
            objects and make accurate decisions. These capabilities also enable these intelligent machines to predict
            events by processing data quickly to provide solutions to problems that occur in real time.

            For example, self-driving cars can predict potential threats, such as car collisions ahead or behind, and
            make decisions to avoid them in real time. Using good data collection sensors, this information can be
            processed and the results obtained as actions. In addition to neural networks and specific algorithms,
            self-driving cars have five core components that help them optimize their operations in real time: computer
            vision, sensor fusion, localization, path planning and control. They also have enhanced AI sensing
            technology that detects pedestrians, vehicles, cyclists, and work and obstacles up to 300 yards away. These
            embedded algorithms help these cars determine and suggest alternative routes based on real-time traffic
            conditions. A remarkable technology, indeed.

          <h1 class = 'hiddenFadeLeft'>Autopilot</h1>
          <p class = 'hiddenFadeLeft'>More recently, Tesla has built self-driving electric cars with Autopilot, which enables automatic steering, acceleration and braking, lane changing and stopping, among other operations. In addition to these features, these cars have the potential to reduce emissions on a global scale, a landmark achievement for fuel-powered vehicles. Today, self-driving cars can be found in some of the world's largest cities. Even heavy trucks without drivers can be built to transport goods over long distances. This not only significantly reduces transportation costs, but also reduces the number of deaths and injuries caused by accidents, most of which are caused by human error.</p>

          <h1 class = 'hiddenFadeLeft'>Artificial Intelligence Enhancements</h1>
          
          <p class = 'hiddenFadeLeft'>Recently, several automotive companies have built self-driving cars with enhanced AI features such as personal AI assistants, radar detectors and cameras, all of which are used to prioritize features such as safety. These self-driving cars have implemented AI enhancements, which is a huge improvement over their predecessors. Autopilot can understand the characteristics exhibited by the driver, such as driving speed, preferred car temperature, driving mood, obeying traffic signs, regular songs or favorite radio stations. By rating driving skills, these self-driving cars help change poor driving behaviors and habits.
