          <p class='hiddenFadeLeft'>
            The idea of one entrusting their safety to a computer piloting them around busy streets, highways, and
            challenging everyday life situations is still met with understandable skepticism. A survey revealed that 71%
            of consumers are afraid to ride in fully self-driving vehicles (AAA Annual Automated Survey 2019). This
            number rose from the previous year's 63% after Uber’s self-driving car struck and killed a pedestrian and
            Tesla’s autopilot led to a fatal crash. Although both incidents were concluded to be a result of human
            negligence, this greatly spoiled the public's opinion on self driving cars.
          </p>
          <p class='hiddenFadeLeft'>
            53% are fine with being transported at low speed and short distances while 44% are fine with use for
            delivery of food or packages. Only a mere 20% trust self driving vehicles to fully transport themselves or
            their families. Many consumers voiced that they would rather current driver assistance features improve
            first before self-driving cars. Gred Brannon, director of AAA’s automotive engineering, says “You can’t sell
            consumers on the future if they don’t trust the present”.

                As one of the benefits of driverless cars are reducing and easing current environmental concerns, some
                environmentalists are the potential target audience of this market. Self-driving cars are powered by
                electricity, and people no longer have to pay the high price of oil and the potential harm caused by
                pollution to the environment. Not only that, it's estimated that a broader scale of full deploy of
                driverless car will reduce global urban CO2 emissions by 80%.

                Driverless car can be implemented on public transportation and ride hailing services such as Uber.
                Without the need of a human driver, it leads to greater safety, efficiency and affordability. Or, those

                need for an on demand, physical driver. Cities with limited public transit coverage would also benefit
                from self-driving cars. Self-driving cars can easily reach areas where infrastructure is lacking.

        <h1> Mobileye: Successful Test Drive</h1>

        <p>
          Mobileye, an Israeli self-driving technology company owned by Intel, became the first company to test a fully
          self-driving car on the streets of New York City at July 20, 2021.
        </p>

        <p>
          While many companies test their cars in California and Arizona, New York is not commonly used as a testing
          location. New York is home to crowded streets, challenging driving dynamics (aggressive drivers plus equally
          rule-averse pedestrians and bicyclists) and variable weather. In addition, the state has a law that
          specifically requires drivers to keep at least one hand on the wheel at all times.
        </p>

        <p>
          But Mobileye has received special permission so that "safety drivers" in its vehicles can keep their hands
          completely off the wheel. Its test vehicles can also operate without a police escort, a common requirement for
          any hands-free driving in cities. As this test run being successful, it has proved that a driverless car is
          safe, even in complex situation, for example, the busy streets of New York City.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="examples-2">
        <h1> Efficiency and Environmental of Driverless Car </h1>

        <p>
          AVs have a massive potential to curb emissions simply because they operate much more efficiently than conventional vehicles. The amount of gas burned by conventional vehicles is affected by the driving style. Typically, more battery is consumed when repeated braking or continuous shifts from low to high speed occurs, for example during traffic congestion. 
        </p>

        <p>
          The highly advanced computers controlling autonomous cars that allow for a much smoother driving experience – with speed and acceleration under control and thus a more efficient fuel use – make them a more environmentally friendly alternative in terms of electricity consumed and overall air pollution generated. According to estimates by the US Department of Energy, this driving style – which industry experts refer to as automated ‘eco-driving’ – can reduce fuel consumption by 15 to 20%.
        </p>

        <p>
          A rise in electric vehicles coupled with the global expansion of renewables will lead to a significant decrease in transport-related emissions. And looking at experts’ forecasts, this might happen sooner than we expect. Investment bank UBS predicts that by 2025, 20% of all new cars sold globally will be electric. Furthermore, the convergence of electric and autonomous vehicles is perfectly aligned, as it is much easier for computers to drive cars with electric propulsion systems. As for renewable energy, clean sources such as hydroelectric, solar, wind, biomass, and geothermal are on the rise worldwide and in 2021 alone, they generated a combined 38% of the world’s electricity.
