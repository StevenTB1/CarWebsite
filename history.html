        <p class='info1Des'>The dream of a self-driving automobile goes as far back as the middle ages, centuries
          prior
          to the invention of the car. The evidence for this comes from a sketching by Leonardo De Vinci that was
          meant
          to be a rough blueprint for a self-propelled cart.

        <p class='info2Des'>Houdina Radio Control Company’s first public<br> demonstration of a driverless car in
          1925.
          The radio<br> impulses drove miniature electric motors that controlled <br>the car's every movement. In
          1925,
          he officially exhibited his <br>radio-controlled driver-less automobile, American Wonder, on <br>the streets of
          New York City, driving up Broadway and down Fifth <br> Avenue in traffic jams. <br>
          Futurama, an exhibit at the 1939 New York World’s Fair. (Concepts) <br> & came up with an automated highway
          system in which cars can drive autonomously, allowing <br>passengers to reach their destinations safely and
          conveniently. (Norman Bel Geddes <br>designed the first self-driving automobile at GM's 1939 show, which was an
          electric vehicle steered by radio-controlled electromagnetic fields generated by magnetized metal spikes
          implanted in the highway.)

        <p class='info3Des'>In 1958, General Motors had made this concept a reality.The car's front end was outfitted
          with pick-up coils, which could detect electricity flowing through a specific technique in the road. The
          current might be changed to instruct the car to shift the steering wheel to the left or right.<br>
          The Japanese improved upon this idea. In 1977, a team at Japan’s Tsukuba Mechanical Engineering Laboratory
          <br> took the first major step of developing what many <br>consider to be the first stand-alone autonomous <br> vehicle.

          million would be awarded to the team of engineers whose vehicle successfully completed the 150-mile obstacle
          course. Despite the fact that none of the cars completed the course, the event was deemed a success since it
