          <h1> Driverless Car vs. Driving Car</h1>

          <p>
            A self-driving car is a vehicle that operates with little to no assistance from a human. Higher levels of
            automation enable driverless automobiles to sense their surroundings, navigate, and operate without a human
            operator.
          </p>

          <p>
            Regular cars are essentially just daily vehicles that are mostly controlled by the driver. All driving
            duties, including navigation and vehicle control, are carried out by humans.

              <p>
                One of the biggest promises of self-driving cars is the possibility of reducing congestion on our
                nation’s roads. If driverless cars were widespread, there could be fewer accidents, fewer traffic jams,
                and reduced demand for highway police and EMTs. Public transportation could become much easier too.

                Ideally, self-driving cars minimize the chance of a person making an error that leads to an accident.
                These vehicles are supposed to stay safely in their lane, follow traffic rules, and protect the people
                inside the vehicle as well as others on the road.

                Wouldn’t it be great if we could do away with speed limits and just trust self-driving cars to transport
                us at rocket speed? This is one of the potentially huge benefits of driverless vehicles. You could get
                home from work in a flash.

              <p>
                Some self-driving cars use less gasoline so if more were on the roads, there could be fewer
                fuel-guzzling traffic jams to harm the environment. Plus, there could be a lower risk of semi-truck
                accidents with chemical spills, explosions, and other environmentally damaging side effects. That’s good
                for the Earth and good for all of us.

                By drastically lowering the frequency of traffic accidents and fatalities, self-driving cars hope to
                benefit people and save lives. Beyond what is feasible in a typical automobile with a human driver,
                driverless cars have the potential to boost speed and safety on the road.

                When an actual human being is driving the car, the driver gains expereince over time. As a result, driving the car by a driver can exericse and train the driver regarding its driving skill. Although driverless car can technically train its model using huge amount of data, it's still enormous compare to a real driver.

                Considering a driverless car, specifically, its implemented program has the potential to be hacked from computer virus, a driver driving the car is immune to these factors when driving a car. On that aspect, a human driver prevents the risk of being hacked and malfunctioned because of the computer virus.

                Based the current development and level of a driverless technologies, a human driver is still way more reliable and trustworthy. Public concerns grows each failure of a driverless car, as everyone is afraid to take on the driverless car. As a result, at the curent stage of the society, a human driver is still most people's go-to option.

              <p>
                Although either normal car and driverless car crashes can be fatal, human's subconscious reactions with great operations will in a degree reduce the impact of the actual car crahses. That do not work the same for driverless car. If the program determines it's empty at the front and it accelerates, the crash, depends on the development of the technology in the car, can be vary but can not be changed manually. To conclude, in the current stage of driverless car, the crashes from a normal car tends to be less fatal.
