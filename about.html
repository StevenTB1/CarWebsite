            A self-driving car is a vehicle that is capable of navigating and driving itself without the need for a
            human driver. It can detect and respond to its surroundings and can be operated without a human passenger
            present in the vehicle. These autonomous vehicles have the same capabilities as a conventional car and can
            perform the same tasks as a human driver.

          <h1>How do self-driving cars work?</h1>
          <p>
            Self-driving cars utilize a combination of sensors, actuators, advanced algorithms, machine learning, and
            powerful processors to operate. These vehicles use sensors to generate a map of their surroundings and
            gather information about nearby vehicles, traffic signals, road signs, other vehicles, pedestrians, and
            more. This data is processed by sophisticated software which determines the appropriate path for the vehicle
            and sends commands to the actuators to control acceleration, braking, and steering. The software also
            includes hard-coded rules, obstacle avoidance capabilities, and the ability to predict and recognize objects
            to help the vehicle safely follow the rules of the road and navigate around obstacles.

        <h1>Benefits of Driverless Cars</h1>

        <p>
          The real promise of self-driving cars is the potential for significant reductions in CO2 emissions. In a
          recent study, experts identified three trends that, if adopted simultaneously, would unlock the full potential
          of self-driving cars: vehicle automation, vehicle electrification, and carpooling. By 2050, these "three
          revolutions in urban mobility" could:

        <div class="points">
          <p>
            Reduce traffic congestion (30% fewer vehicles on the road).
          </p>

          <p>
            Reduce transportation costs by 40% (in terms of vehicles, fuel and infrastructure).
          </p>

          <p>
            Improve mobility and livability.
          </p>

          <p>
            Free up parking lots for other uses (schools, parks, community centers).
          </p>

          <p>
            Reduce global urban CO2 emissions by 80%.

          <h2>
            Weather conditions
          </h2>
          <p>
            What happens when a self-driving car drives in heavy rain? If there is a layer of snow on the road, the lane
            dividers will disappear. How will the cameras and sensors track lane markings if the markings are obscured
            by water, oil, ice or debris?
          </p>

          <h2>
            Accident Liability
          </h2>
          <p>
            Who is responsible for accidents caused by self-driving cars? The manufacturer? Human passengers? The latest blueprints suggest that fully autonomous Level 5 cars will have no dashboard or steering wheel, so human passengers will not even have the option to take control of the vehicle in an emergency.
          </p>
        </div>

          <h2>
            Human and Emotional Intelligence
          </h2>
          <p>
            Human drivers rely on subtle cues and nonverbal communication - such as making eye contact with pedestrians or reading the facial expressions and body language of other drivers - to make snap judgments and predict behavior. Can self-driving cars replicate this connection? Will they have the same life-saving instincts as human drivers?
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="small-point">
          <h2>
            Traffic conditions and laws
          </h2>
          <p>
            Will self-driving cars have trouble with tunnels or bridges? How will they cope with the successive traffic? Will self-driving cars be relegated to specific lanes? Will they be granted the right to use carpool lanes? What about the older fleets that will still be on the road in the next 20 or 30 years?
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="small-point">
          <h2>
            LIDAR and Radar
          </h2>
          <p>
            LIDAR is expensive and still struggling to strike the right balance between range and resolution. If multiple self-driving cars are driving on the same road, will their LIDAR signals interfere with each other? If multiple radio frequencies are available, will the frequency range be sufficient to support the mass production of self-driving cars.
